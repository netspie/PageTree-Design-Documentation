## Problems and Inspirations

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning a new language is an exciting and rewarding experience, it can be also challenging, 
especially when you don't know where to start or how to go about it. 

If you are struggling to learn japanese, you are not alone. 

I often can see people asking where to start learning japanese language, and how?
One of the biggest challenges for many learners is not knowing any of that.
With so many resources available online and offline, it can be overwhelming to decide what to use and where to begin.
Book? Blogs? Youtube videos? Courses? Online teachers? Schools? Apps? So many options.

How much money and effort can you afford? How much should you learn and how often? What should be 
the order of subjects in which I should learn them? These and tone more questions.

Wouldn't it be great if everyone could just use a tool, which just does the job for you, makes it possible to learn anything easily, quickly
anywhere, anytime? Without fear you forget anything or if so, you can control it and focus on that?

Many learners don't know how to learn effectively. There is so many options

The truth is everyday speaking is different from what you can learn from books.

I personally struggle with learning things, it's often very chaotic. It would be nice to learn anything from beginning to end.
At least solid fundamentals.
