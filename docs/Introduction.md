## Problems and Inspirations

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning a new language is an exciting and rewarding experience, it can be also challenging, 
especially when you don't know where to start or how to go about it. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I often can see people asking where to start learning japanese language, and how?
With so many resources available online and offline, it can be overwhelming to decide what to use and where to begin.
Book? Blogs? Youtube videos? Courses? Online teachers? Schools? Apps? So many options. How much money and effort can you afford? How much should you learn and how often? What should be the order of subjects in which I should learn them? These and tone more questions.

Many learners don't know how to learn effectively. There is so many techniques you can use to improve your memorization ability.
However, one thing is key - repetition. It is essential to language learning, but it can become monotonous over time.
To keep things interesting, when studying words or grammar, you can practice by writing sentences, listening to dialogues, or taking quizzes. 
You can also try different topics or genres of media, such as news articles, songs, or movies, to keep things fresh.

Wouldn't it be great if everyone could just use a tool, which just does the job for you, makes it possible to learn anything easily, quickly
anywhere, anytime? Without fear you forget anything or if so, you can go back, control it and focus on that?

The truth is everyday speaking is different from what you can learn from books.

I personally struggle with learning things, it's often very chaotic. It would be nice to learn anything from beginning to end with ease.
At least solid fundamentals. 

To become proficient in Japanese, it is important to practice all aspects of the language. However, it can be challenging to find resources that cover all four skills equally. One way to address this is to create a balanced study plan that incorporates different activities for each skill. For example, you can practice speaking with a language exchange partner, listening to Japanese podcasts, reading Japanese books or news articles, and writing in a journal.

Rehearsing and reviewing what you have learned is essential to retaining knowledge. However, it can be difficult to remember everything you have learned, especially if you don't have a structured system for reviewing. One way to overcome this is to use spaced repetition software, such as Anki or Memrise, which uses a flashcard system to help you memorize new vocabulary and grammar. You can also create your own review system using a journal or notebook.

Sometimes, it can be hard to learn a single concept without understanding all the prerequisites. This can be frustrating and discouraging. One way to overcome this is to focus on the specific concept you want to learn and break it down into smaller parts. Start by learning the basics and then gradually build up your knowledge. You can also use resources that provide explanations and examples of the concept in a simpler way. For example, if you want to learn a Japanese song, start by focusing on the chorus and gradually work your way up to the verses.

Technology has made language learning more accessible than ever before. However, it can also be a barrier if you don't have access to the right tools. To overcome this challenge, try to use resources that are available on different devices and platforms, such as mobile apps, online courses, or textbooks. You can also use offline resources, such as flashcards or books, to continue learning when you don't have access to the internet.

Learning in a structured way can help you make progress more efficiently and effectively. To do this, it is important to use resources that are well-organized and follow a clear progression. For example, you can use textbooks, online courses, or language schools that have a set curriculum and provide structured lessons. You can also create your own study plan and organize your resources based on your goals and priorities.

Learning a new language can be challenging, but it can also be enjoyable and rewarding. To make learning more fun and easy, try to find resources that are engaging and interactive. You can also use gamification techniques, such as setting goals, earning rewards, or competing with others, to make learning more motivating. Finally, try to be mindful of your learning style and preferences, and find ways to make the process more enjoyable for yourself.

Forgetting what you have learned can be frustrating and demotivating. To avoid this, try to use a spaced repetition system or review regularly to reinforce what you have learned. You can also try to use what you have learned in real-life situations, such as practicing with a language exchange partner or writing in a journal. Finally, be patient and persistent, and remember that language learning is a long-term process that requires consistent effort and practice.
