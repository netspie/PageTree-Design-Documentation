### Problem Description

Here are the questions I noticed other people asking:
- Where to learn japanese language from? 
- How to memorize and rehearse learned material?

Here are the other problems I noticed myself when learning from the existing media:
- Struggle with writing notes from videos, courses, articles, lectures - so much effort, time-consuming.
- Cannot learn over and over again from the same notes in the same order - it becomes so boring, gives no challenge anymore, makes you procrastinate.
- Does not provide tools for learning various aspects like reading, listening, speaking, writing.
- Does not provide materials for different media types in a single base, it's all scattered all over the internet:
  - linguistics - if I want to deeply understand the language structure and rules, its elements - radicals, kanji, kana, words, basic phrases, everything
  - everyday speaking depending on different situations, places, people we talk to
  - arts like manga, anime, songs, poems, stories, movies
  - newspaper, websites, tv
- Hard to get back and rehearse your knowledge in an easy way. No automation. No challenging tasks.
- If knowledge is there, it's not easy to find it and go back to if we want to rehearse it.
- Hard to learn just a single item, ex. song, anime episode, due to lack of easily understandable explanation of it's parts
- If I learned just one thing briefly, no way to understand it or its parts deeper whenever I want without additional research in the internet.
- Hard to learn or rehearse anywhere, anytime because of connectivity or mobile usability issues.
- Often can't learn in an organized way, from structured, well prepared standarized single knowledge base.
- Not fun.
- If a content is quite good, it does not provide tools for rehearsal, so I don't forget things.
