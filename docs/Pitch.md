### Problem Description

- Don't know where and how to start learning japanese in general.
- Struggle with writing notes from videos, courses, articles, lectures - too much effort, boring, time-consuming.
- Can't handle doing same things over and over again, looking on the same notes, same order, gives me headache, is boring, gives no challenge anymore, starting procrastinating.
- Wanna learn all aspects - reading, listening, speaking, writing.
- Wanna learn all media types - everyday speaking; different situations; art - anime, songs, articles; newspaper, websites
- Hard to get back and rehearse your knowledge in an easy way. No automation. No challenging tasks.
- Hard to learn just a single concept of a subject, ex. song, anime episode, due to too much prerequisities, while it could be explained just enough for now.
- I wanna learn just one thing, but also have option to understand it or its parts deeper whenever I want without additional research. It's should be all here.
- Don't wanna be prevented from learn anywhere, anytime because of missing technology.
- Learn in a structured way, from structured, well prepared standarized knowledge base.
- I want the learning to be fun, easy, little effort, no wasting time to organize things.
- I wanna read a book / article or watch a lesson/course with ready tool for learning.
- I want to not forget things.
